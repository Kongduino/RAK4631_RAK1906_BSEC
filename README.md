# RAK4631 RAK1906 BSEC

An example project demonstrating how to save the RAK1906/BME680's IAQ state to the File System via LittleFS and retrieve it when rebooting, in order to avoid restarting the 4-day heat-up period.

It is using the `config/generic_33v_3s_4d/bsec_iaq.txt` config file provided by Bosch. I believe that the IAQ polling frequency should then be 3 seconds â€“ but Bosch is being a bit sparse on details. In the sketch the IAQ polling delay is 10 seconds, BUT,... you can adjust that in the Serial Monitor.

## Batteries Included!

This sketch comes with an extensible command framework, which has for now 5^h 7^H 9 commands:

```
/help
Available commands: 9
 . help: Shows this help.
 . bsec_fq: Gets/sets the save interval in seconds.
 . iaq_fq: Gets/sets the IAQ polling in seconds.
 . msl: Gets/sets the current MSL Pressure in HPa.
 . alt: Computes the altitude based on the current MSL.
 . save: Saves BSEC status.
 . poll: Polls the BME680.
 . backup: Retrieves the current state as HEX.
 . restore: Uploads current state as HEX to BME680.```
```

You can enquire at which frequency the IAQ is polled, as I mentioned, and at which frequency the IAQ status is saved to the file system. You don't want to do this too often. It is set up right now at one hour, but should probably be set at something longer, 4 hours or more.

You can also force-save, if you so desire â€“ this can be useful if you need to unplug, making sure you have the latest before turning off. And of course force-polling the BME680 has no particular side effects. If you're impatient, hit that `/save` command!


```
Let's go!

*Now waiting desperately for that ` . IAQ: 25.00` to change to something meaningful...*

## UPDATES

### MSL / ALT

Just added two commands:

```
 . msl: Gets/sets the current MSL Pressure in HPa.
 . alt: Computes the altitude based on the current MSL.
```

`/msl` will return the current MSL Pressure, whereas `/msl xxxx` will update it. This will help get an accurate altitude with `/alt`.

```

## Backup / Restore state

If you are deploying to more than one device, you might want to synchronize all devices and set them to the same state. The `backup` command will compile the current state to a command + Base64-encoded string. Run that command to set the next BME680 to this state.

```
/restore AAgEAT0AAAAAAAAAcwAAAC0AAaUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP//AgIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgwAAqUAAMhBAADIQRAAA6UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWAAWlAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAJpf////////9/CAAKpQAAAAAAAAAAypYAAA==
Saving state to BME680.
```
